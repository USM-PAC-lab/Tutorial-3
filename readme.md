### Tutorial 3

Welcome to what is likely the last tutorial, unless you all feel you need more help.

# **For this tutorial, please create your own repository on your own GitHub! You will not be using this one until the very end**

You will be doing the [roll-a-ball-tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball-tutorial) by unity. This is a great beginner level course for unity, and it's how I learned how to use it.

You will be committing your changes at least after every video, but please do more as you see fit. For this project, you will likely only need your master branch, so don't worry about branching today. 

**You will need GIT-LFS to make this work!**

When you are finished, please upload a text file to _this repository_ stating you have finished the roll-a-ball tutorial! I'll download your finished product and test to make sure everything works! 

Good luck! Ask questions!
